# Boston-housing-price-prediction
We are going to apply some regression techniques to create a marketable model for forecasting house prices based on several attributes in the dataset known as Boston House Price Prediction. Here are a few processing methods for building models.

## Problem Statement
Housing prices are a significant indicator of the health of the economy, and both buyers and sellers are keenly interested in price points. If you ask a prospective homeowner to describe their ideal home, they usually won't start by talking about how high the basement ceiling is or how close the house is to an east-west railroad. However, the data from this playground competition demonstrates that factors other than the number of beds or a white picket fence have a significant impact on price negotiations.

## Data Overview
Using this dataset, which was created to forecast Boston home prices. Here, I'm merely listing each house's features individually. such as the number of rooms, the area's crime rate, and so on. The next section will demonstrate.

1. CRIM per capital crime rate by town

2. ZN proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

3. INDUS proportion of non-retail business acres per town

4. CHAS Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)

5. NOX nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)

6. RM average number of rooms per dwelling

7. AGE proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940

8. DIS weighted distances to five Boston employment centers

9. RAD index of accessibility to radial highways

10.TAX full-value property-tax rate per 10,000 USD

11. PTRATIO pupil-teacher ratio by town

12. Black 1000(Bk — 0.63)² where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town

13. LSTAT % lower status of the population
